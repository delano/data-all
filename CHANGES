Revision history for Perl extension Data::All.

0.036  Fri Jul 15 16:01:10 2005
    - Spelling correction

0.032  Wed Apr 27 15:48:22 2005
    - Commented out several troublesome warns()

0.031  Mon May 17 15:46:29 2004
	- Overhauled interface to Data::All
		- The usage of from => ..., to => ... now standardized
		- Removed the notion of monikers (useless!)
	- Collections can now be converted record by record rather than 
		atomically (setting atomic => 1 will do the opposite)
	- Many bug fixes

0.026  Mon May 10 10:21:54 2004
	- Bug fixes (option parsing, creating new files)
	- Added Data::All::IO::FTP (not fully implemented)

0.025  Thu May 06 08:51:02 2004
	- Added test t/Data-All.t
	- Bug fixes to Data::All::IO::Database, in particular the way data
		is read from a select.
	- Record terminator in Data::All::Format::Fixed is hardcoded to \n
		(temporarily). The record teminator needs to be revisited at
		some point and this will be fixed at that time.

0.023  Wed Apr 29 09:28:21 2004
        - Nominal distribution fix (again :[ )

0.021  Wed Apr 28 17:32:11 2004
	- Nominal distribution fix

0.020  Wed Apr 28 17:23:00 2004
	- Data:All::convert() changes
		- requires parameters as a hash (or hashref)
		- defaults to processing record by record (rather than 
			by entire collection)
		- now accepts various (yet undocumented, sorry) options
			(such as whether to process record by record or 
			whether to output a field list record in the output)
	- Several Data::All::IO::Database changes
		- Autocommit now defaults to off (currently hardcoded). A
			commit is run in Data::All::IO::Database::close().
		- Interpolated query variables (i.e. ?,?,?) can be included
			before and after the field vars. 
	- Initial inclusion of Log::Log4perl. Currently at a useless state
		though

0.016  Fri Apr 23 16:31:25 2004
	- Initial CPAN distribution
